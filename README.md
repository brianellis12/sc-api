Fast API Rest Service paired with Data Maps [Client](https://github.com/brianellis12/sc-client) to build a map and display U.S. Census Bureau Data for a selected location.

## Local Setup
- Clone repository, navigate to the src directory and run `pip install -r requirements` to install all dependencies.
- If not already installed, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- In the project root, run `docker-compose build`
- Once the build process is done, run `docker-compose up` to run the project
